# lsh — a simple Unix shell in C

This repository contains a small Unix-like shell written in C. It is a learning project inspired by Stephen Brennan's "Write a Shell in C" tutorial. The shell implements a basic read-parse-execute loop with a few builtins (`cd`, `help`, `exit`) and supports launching programs via `fork` and `execvp`.
